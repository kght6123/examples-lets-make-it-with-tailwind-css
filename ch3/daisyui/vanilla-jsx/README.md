The app is a proof-of-concept of how you can use the JSX in vanilla TypeScript + Vite project, no framework needed!

This project is for you, if you:

* ‚öõÔ∏è Have experience with React, but no idea about how it handles JSX
* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Curious about front-end fundamentals
* ü§ì A geek who loves vanilla TypeScript and all around it

## How to run?

Like in any Node.js app, install dependencies and run the `dev` script:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can go to `http://localhost:3000` and try adding your JSX code, while enjoying HMR and TypeScript.

## How does it work?

**Notice**: full explanation of Vanilla JSX is [posted on Habr](https://habr.com/ru/post/659483/) (Russian language).

**JSX** is basically a syntactic extension over JS, and, just like TypeScript, it needs to be compiled.

![JSX Code transformation: from code to typescript parser, vite bundler, into the Vanilla JS code](public/flowchart.png)

The flowchart shows that, to get the vanilla JS code from JSX, we need to instruct the TypeScript or Vite (in case the project is without TS) compilers to parse the JSX and transform it into the required form. So, what instructions do they need? Well, all the TypeScript need (in `tsconfig.json`) is:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "jsxFactory": "h",
    "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
  }
}
```

And Vite requires the following `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  esbuild: {
    jsxFactory: 'h',
    jsxFragment: 'Fragment'
  }
});
```

These instructions tell the compilers to use the `h` and `Fragment` functions to work with your JSX. Compilers parse the `.jsx` or `.tsx` files, produce their own representation of the data in JSX and feed this data to the `h` function.

The `h` function is called the **JSX Pragma**. In React, the pragma is the `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)` function, which is clearly described in [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html). In our case, though, `h` is written by ourselves in `src/pragma.ts` file.

```ts
type Tag = string | ((props: any, children: any[]) => JSX.Element);
type Props = Record<string, string | number | null | undefined> | null;
type Children = (Node | string)[];

export const h = (tag: Tag, props: Props, ...children: Children) => {
  // If the tag is a function component, pass props and children inside it
  if (typeof tag === 'function') {
    return tag({ ... props }, children);
  }

  // Create the element and add attributes to it
  const el = document.createElement(tag);
  if (props) {
    Object.entries(props).forEach(([key, val]) => {
      if (key === 'className') {
        el.classList.add(...(val as string || '').trim().split(' '));
        return;
      }

      (el as any)[key as keyof HTMLElement] = val;
    });
  }

  // Append all children to the element
  children.forEach((child) => {
    el.append(child);
  });

  return el;
};
```

As you can see, all the Pragma does is go through the parsed JSX and create DOM elements with correct attributes and children. This allows the magic to happen when you import the `h` to your functional components. That's it!

## Limitations

Vanilla JSX requires you a lot of engineering if you want to create a bigger app than this example. At least, making any component interactive would make you re-invent the reactivity. For example, a simple button that changes the view might require additional logic to Pragma: wrappers around event listeners, tracking the changes, etc.

If you are interested, I have **a task for you**: create a `CounterComponent` that simply displays decrease and increase buttons and the counter itself. It might teach you the principles of reactivity üèé
